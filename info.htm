    <FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=-1>Nobody knows. Stone circles date from the mid-Neolithic Period to the late Bronze Age, about 3500 to 1000 BC. Around 900 of these megalithic monuments lie scattered across the British landscape although this figure represents far fewer than were originally built. Over the centuries, farmers have buried or hauled away many of the obstructive circles. Other circles were felled for their pagan reputation.<P> 
      Technically there are three types of circular enclosure:<P>

    <CENTER><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style" COLOR="#DF9B17" SIZE=-1>Henges</FONT></CENTER><BR>
      Henges are earthen enclosures without standing stones. They are mainly found in the East of Britain (Norfolk to West Lothian) on low-lying ground, usually close to a stream or river, varying in size, from less than 50 feet in diameter to over 500 feet.<P>

    Stone circles are a set of standing stones with an entrance and are mainly found in the West of England and in Northern Scotland on hillsides with commanding views or, like henges, in low-lying, level places near water. They average 100 to 200 feet in diameter, though a few are as large as the largest henges.<P>

    <CENTER><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style" COLOR="#DF9B17" SIZE=-1>Circle Henges</FONT></CENTER><BR>
      The circle henge is a combination of both circle and henge and is less common. Henges lie to the East of Britain and Scotland and stone circles to the West, the two forms uniting in the middle of Southern Britain and Northern Scotland. Stonehenge, Wiltshire, is the best example of a circle henge.<P>

    <FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=-1>CUPS are circular hollows carved out of the rock by a sharp stone or antler.<BR>

         Cup and ring marks are often found close to burial mounds, but their purpose and meaning remains unknown.<P>
